== Description ==

"Wp-o-matic-Authors" is an add-on to Wp-o-Matic. It automatically creates a new author for each campaign (even if already fetched). Then, each post imported by Wp-o-Matic will have as author the name given by this plugin instead of a name already registered in the core blog. You need to install the Wp-o-Matic version included in this package instead of the official one that does not include some code about authors.


== Installation ==

1. Copy the the two folders "Wpoauthors" and "WP-o-Matic" into the wp-content/plugins folder of your WordPress installation. 
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure the plugin through the 'Settings' menu in WordPress.
